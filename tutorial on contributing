ok so first of all:
sudo su
git clone (otto repository)
cd (otto repository) 

also u have to stop docker before making ur changes: 
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)

then what ur gunna wanna do is:
docker build -t searxng .

and once thats done do this:
docker run -d --name (your name here) -p 8890:8080 searxng

(ur gunna want to change the name at the end every time you want to see your changes

if ur having any problems with setting the thing up, use Chatgpt or something and copy the error lol

also heres where u can test it: http://localhost:8890/
